# Docker Datacenter
Docker Datacenter CaaS (Containers-as-a-Service) enables enterprises to deploy Containers on-premises and on their virtual private cloud (VPC). We will see the Shippable CI/CD workflow, involving the following components of Docker Datacenter.

- __Docker Trusted Registry__ (DTR) - Pull and push images to your Docker Datacenter.
- __Universal Control Plane__ (UCP) - Deploy and manage containers on your Docker Datacenter.

---

## Continuous Integration

Throughout the demo, we will use a [sample node.js application](https://github.com/shippablesamples/sample_node_ddc) to demonstrate the workflow.

Once you enable your project, it is critical to have a `shippable.yml` file to use Shippable CI. The `shippable.yml` file includes instructions to run your tests and push your docker images to a registry. To know more about the CI workflow, please check the [CI overview](/ci/overview).

Lets review the `shippable.yml` file of the sample application.
```yaml
language: node_js

version:
  - 0.12

build:
  ci:
    - npm install -g mocha
    - npm install
    - npm run unit-tests
    - npm start &
    - npm run api-tests

  post_ci:
    - docker build -t ship-dtr.in/shippable-ci/sample_node_ddc:$BRANCH.$BUILD_NUMBER .
    - docker push ship-dtr.in/shippable-ci/sample_node_ddc:$BRANCH.$BUILD_NUMBER

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName : "Shippable-DTR"
      type : Docker Trusted Registry
```
In the ci section shown above, we issue commands to run tests. Once the tests are complete, the docker image is pushed to a registry. ( Check the [supported registries](/ci/supported) ).

In the sample application, we will push the docker images to the Docker Trusted Registry using the integration named `Shippable-DTR` ( Check how to create integration for a docker registry in Shippable **UpdateLink**

## Continuous Delivery
After we push the images to Docker Trusted Registry, the latest image automatically deploys to Docker Datacenter. Shippable Pipelines provides the choice of deploying containers to Docker Datacenter, manually & automatically, once the project build is complete.

Configuring the deployment process involves two steps.

* __Environment Creation__ - Specify the infrastructure to be used to deploy ( in our case, it is the default swarm cluster of  Universal Control Plane )
* __Pipeline Creation__ - Specify the image, tag pattern and other configurations like port mapping, environment variables etc. for deployment.

#### Environment Creation
You can follow the instructions [here](pipelines_configure#using-an-existing-docker-datacenter) to create a new Environment.

#### Pipeline Creation
After Creating an Environment, Click on "Add Pipeline" and you will be redirected to Pipeline creation page.

* Give a __Pipeline Name__. This name will be used in naming the containers created on Docker Datacenter. Containers will be named by the pattern *PipelineName-PipelineId-ImageNumber-ReplicaNumber*

* Configure __Cell Manifest__. In this section, you can choose to add one or more docker images that are stored in the [supported registries](/ci/supported). We will add `ship-dtr.in/shippable-ci/sample_node_ddc` that we push in the Continuous Integration phase and specify the key values for Environment variables.

While adding the image, you can configure various options like Port Mapping, Memory Limit etc.

* Configure the __Auto Increment__ and __Pipeline Trigger__. For example, if you set the pattern as `master.*`, Newer versions of Cell Manifest will be created whenever newer tags matching that pattern is available (i.e. master.1, master.2,...,master.N) and the projects specified in the Pipeline Trigger will trigger auto deploy whenever, a build finishes.

* Save the Pipeline and now you are ready to deploy your application. You can get an idea of doing various pipeline operations from [here](pipelines_configure/#deploy-a-cell).

* Since, we have mapped the Container Port 80 with Host port 30662, we can access the Web server running in the container via that port. Make sure to expose the port 30662 on your firewall. If everything went right, you should see this already !
