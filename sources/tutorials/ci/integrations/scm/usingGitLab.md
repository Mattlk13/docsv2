# Using Shippable with GitLab

Shippable supports running CI builds for GitLab. To set this up, you'll first
need to sign into Shippable using a GitHub or BitBucket.
Then follow the steps mentioned here **UpdateLink** to add GitLab as
an Account Integration and sync your Subscriptions. Once complete, you can
enable a project/repository and setup a `shippable.yml` file to get your builds running.

---

## Builds

Builds are automatically triggered every time you commit code or open a new
merge request.

---

## Merge Requests

Shippable triggers builds for all commits & merge requests, hence you can
commit/merge code confidently without breaking your app.

---

## Build Status

Shippable supports displaying GitLab build status right where you need it by
integrating with GitLab build status API.
