#Subscription
A subscription on Shippable corresponds to an individual or organizational subscription on GitHub/Bitbucket. Your pricing plans are enforced at this level, so you need to determine your minion needs for each subscription.

* * *

## CI Dashboard
The `CI` tab of your Subscription page shows you the latest status of all enabled projects. You can also view in progress builds and build history.

To get to the CI dashboard,

- Login to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com)
- Click on the `Subscriptions` dropdown and select the subscription you want to view.
- This will bring you to the CI tab which shows you the latest status for your projects.

The **Summary View** is the default view when you navigate to this dashboard.

By default, you will see the status of the most recent commit builds for all enabled projects. The default branch of the repository, as configured in your source control account, is used.

You can customize the branch(es) shown on this page and also configure this view to include status for pull request builds. More details on this in the [Dashboard Settings for Projects](ci_projects/#dashboard-settings).

If a build is queued or in progress, you will see at the top of the 'Dashboard' view.

NOTE: To view time stamp for a build, hover the mouse over time details

<img src="../images/subscription_dashboard.png" alt="Subscription Dashboard" style="width:700px;"/>


The **History View** shows the build history across all enabled project in the subscription. You can filter this view by commit vs pull request builds, build status, and project name.

You can also see how many minions are being used at the current time by looking at the **Minion usage** count.

* * *

## Project actions

You can enable projects and trigger manual builds from the CI tab of the Subscription page.

###Enabling a project

You can enable a project for CI by doing the following:

- Click on the `Enable Project` button on your `Subscription` page. This brings you to the page with the list of repositories that are not yet enabled within your subscription.
- Click on the `Enable` button to enable a particular repository. If you have a long list of repositories, pull it up by typing the name of the repo to filter by name and enable it.
- If you have recently added a repository to github/bitbucket and do not see it in the list, click on the `Sync` button. Once the sync is complete, you should see the new repo in the list, for you to enable.

After enabling a project you will be redirected to the project's page on Shippable. More details on this are in our [Projects section](ci_projects.md).

<img src="../images/ci_subscriptions_mv_enable_project.gif" alt="Enable a project" style="width:700px;"/>


### Building a Project
Once enabled, you can build a project in the following ways -

* Committing a change to the repository in your source control.This automatically triggers a build for the project on Shippable.
* Opening a pull request to an enabled repository. This automatically triggers a build on Shippable.
* Triggering a manual build from the Shippable UI (This will build latest code)
* Rebuilding a previous build from the Shippable UI

You can trigger manual builds for an enabled project by clicking on `Build` for a project in the **Summary View** of the subscription dashboard. To rebuild a previous build, go to the **History view** and click on `Rebuild` for any build listed there.

* * *

## Settings
You can perform subscription level actions by clicking on the `Settings` tab on the Subscription page.

### Options
#### Machine Images
The Machine Images section has a list of images that are available to run your builds. All the builds for your subscription will be using the stable image by default. You can switch to other images based on your requirements. Once you switch the images, all the builds for your subscription will be using the image that you have selected and you can switch back to the default version anytime.

To select your Machine Image, Go to the 'Settings' tab of your 'Subscription'. Click on the 'Options' tab and select from the dropdown under the 'Machine Images' section. 

Here is the list of contents of the machine images

* Stable
    * Shippable Official Images.
    * Docker Server Version: 1.9.1
    * Storage Driver: aufs
    * Root Dir: /data/aufs
    * Backing Filesystem: extfs
    * Dirperm1 Supported: true
    * Execution Driver: native-0.2
    * Logging Driver: json-file
    * Kernel Version: 3.19.0-51-generic
    * Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

* Unstable
    * Shippable Official Images.
    * Docker Server Version: 1.11.1
    * Storage Driver: aufs
    * Root Dir: /data/aufs
    * Backing Filesystem: extfs
    * Dirperm1 Supported: true
    * Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs
    * Kernel Version: 3.19.0-51-generic
    * Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

Please note that the stable version has been tested rigorously to work generically across the board and the unstable image has been tested for specific requirements.

#### Deployment key
The Deployment key section shows the SSH public key associated with your Shippable Account. You will need this key to deploy to cloud providers that supports git based deployments like Heroku and Red Hat Openshift. This key is also used to encrypt any environment variables that you want to use during your build.

Our How To guides provide instructions on how to enable continuous deployment to different providers.

#### Technical Contact
Do ensure this field is populated with a valid email address for the subscription. This email will be used to notify information on service upgrades, service performance and other related topics. It will not be used for marketing purposes.

#### Billing Contact
Do ensure this field is populated with a valid email address for the subscription. This email will be used to send billing invoices for this subscription.

#### Reset Subscription
Resetting a subscription recreates all webhooks and deployment keys for your subscription. This should only be done if your subscription is in an inconsistent state and you need to restore it. Please note that you will need to re-encrypt all environment variables for your subscription after resetting it.

### Integrations
Integrations are added at a subscription level and they are available to be configured for a project by any user, with access to the subscription level. 

For example, if an integration is added to an organization subscription, all users with access to the organization's subscription can configure the integration for their projects. 

You can view all the configured integrations for your account by going to the 'Account Settings' and clicking the 'Integrations' section. It will display a list of all integrations that are configured and available for your projects.

#### Adding integrations

To add an integration for a project, you'll need to add it in the UI for the project's subscription and include it in the `shippable.yml` file for that project. 

Add the integration to a subscription, in the UI, through **Subscription Settings**: 

1. Go to the 'Settings' tab of your subscription and click the 'Integrations' section on the left side menu.

2. Click 'Add Integration' and select the list of integrations available in the dropdown of the 'Account Integrations' field.
     <img src="../images/add_integration_for_subscription.png" alt="Add Integration to a Subscription" style="width:700px;"/>
     
3. Ensure the 'Integration Name' you input **is exactly the same** as the one you configure in the `shippable.yml` file. If they are not the same, then the build will fail with an error as [described in our troubleshooting section](ci_troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). 
<img src="../images/add_integration_for_subscription_2.png" alt="Add Integration to a Subscription" style="width:700px;"/>


NOTE: If you don't see an integration in the dropdown, you will need to create one. To do so:

- Click on the '+ Add integration' from the dropdown choices of the 'Account Integrations' field as shown above in Step 3.
- Create the integration. [Detailed instructions here](int_overview/#adding-an-account-integration).
- Once you create this integration, add it to  your subscription by following Steps 2 and 3. 

**IMPORTANT**: After adding the 'Integrations' in the UI, you'll need to configure the same in the `shippable.yml` file for the project. More details on [yml config here](ci_configure.md). The same is true for any Docker registry integrations.

### Encrypt
#### Encrypting your environment variables
Shippable allows you to encrypt your environment variable definitions and keep your configurations private in your shippable.yml by using the `secure` tag.

To encrypt a variable, enter the environment variable and its values in the text box as shown below and click on `Encrypt`-

```
name="abc"
```
To encrypt multiple variables, you can use the following syntax-

```
var1="abc" var2="xyz"
```
You can now use these encrypted variables in your shippable.yml with a secure tag . For example,

```
env:
  secure: <encrypted output>
```

### Billing
A subscription on Shippable corresponds to an individual or organizational subscription on GitHub/Bitbucket. Your pricing plans are enforced at a subscription level, so you need to determine your build minion and pipeline needs for each subscription.

To get to the Subscription Billing page:
- Login to [Shippable](http://www.shippable.com).
- Click on the `Subscriptions` dropdown and select the subscription you want to view.
- Click on the Billing tab to view and manage your plan.

By default, you are subscribed to the 'Continuous Deivery' free plan. It includes:
- One free CI build container (2 core, 3.75GB RAM) that supports unlimited public and private repositories for unlimited users from your source control provider. You can run as many builds as you want.
- One free Pipeline, that allows you to set up deployment for one Cell.

<img src="../images/ci_subscription_plan.png" alt="Subscription Plan" style="width:700px;"/>

####Upgrade your plan

You should buy more build minions if:
- Your builds need bigger minions than the one in your free plan. All paid minions come with 2 cores, 3.75GB RAM (as opposed to 1 core, 2GB RAM with the free plan)
- Your team is growing and your builds are frequently queued as a result, which means your developers wait longer to get build results. Buying more minions will enable parallel execution of builds and reduce queuing time.

You should buy more pipelines if your application has more than 1 unit of deployment. These can be tiers, services, or microservice.

Read more about [when and how to upgrade your subscription](http://blog.shippable.com/how-to-upgrade-your-ci-cd-subscription).

To buy more build minions or pipelines, simply slide the slider to the number of minions and/or pipelines you need. Choose a credit card, or Enter a new credit card and click on Buy.

We will charge your credit card immediately and send you an invoice. You can also view past invoices on this page.

####Downgrade your plan

You can downgrade your plan at any time by moving the slider to the number of minions and/or pipelines you need. Please note that any minion count changes due to your plan downgrade will be effective immediately and you will not receive a partial or prorated refund if you make this change in the middle of a billing cycle. Your new price will be reflected in your next invoice.


### Nodes

By default, all your builds run inside build containers hosted on Shippable's infrastructure. However, you can choose to run your builds on your own infrastructure, i.e. you can '**Bring Your Own Node (BYON)**'. To understand the advantages of BYON, check out the [Running builds on your machines section](ci_byoh.md).

The 'Build Infrastructure' section lets you set up your own infrastructure if desired.
To do so, select the radio button for `My Node` and follow instructions for adding a build node below.

Please note that you need to add one build node per parallel build, up to a maximum of the number of parallel builds allowed in your plan.

#### Adding a build node
* To add a build machine, click on the `Add node` button. You will be redirected to the Add Node page.
* Enter a name for the node and its IP address.
* You can choose to initialize the build host through Shippable or run the initialization scripts yourself. Initialization through Shippable requires you to grant SSH access, so if you do not want to grant that for any reason, select the radio button for `I want to run the scripts myself`
* To initialize the node through Shippable,
    * Enter the SSH port for your build host. This is usually port 22, but is configurable.
    * Choose whether you want to enable swap space on your machine. This is recommended.
    * Copy the command shown and run it on your build host. This will create a shippable user on your host and allow us to run initialization scripts on your machine.
    * Check the checkbox to confirm that you have run the command on your machine and click on `Initialize`
    * You will be redirected to a page showing you the console log as your machine is initialized.
    * When your node is ready, the status indicator on will turn green.
* To run the initialization scripts yourself,
    * Choose whether you want to enable swap space on your machine. This is recommended.
    * Click on `Generate initialization scripts` to generate the script.
    * Click on `Download scripts` to download. Copy it to your build machine and run them.
    * Check the `I have run this script on my node successfully` and then click on the `Save` button.
    * Your node status will automatically show green at this point. We have no way of verifying that the node was in fact successfully initialized so you will need to make sure this was the case.

Once you add your first build node, all subsequent builds for that subscription will run on your machines.

#### Editing a build node
You can click on the `Edit` button for a build node to edit the node name. Nothing else can be edited for a node.

#### Re-initializing a build node
You can reinitialize a node by clicking on the `Reinitialize` button. This will reset the node and initialize/install everything from scratch. You can only reinitialize nodes provisioned on Shippable's infrastructure. If you have added your own build nodes, you will need to redownload the initialization script and run it on your node.

#### Deleting a build node
Click on `Delete` to delete your build node. This action is final and cannot be undone.
