# Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)

##Adding the Account Integration

You will need to configure this integration to pull or push images to Amazon ECR.

1. Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the 'Integrations' section.
2. Click on the `Add Integration` button.
3. For 'Integration type', choose `Amazon ECR` from the list of dropdown choices.
4. For 'Integration Name' use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `ecr-integration`
5. Enter your aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key. You can follow instructions in [Amazon's guide for Creating and Managing access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html)  
12. Click on `Save`

The integration will now be available to all your continuous integration and deployment workflows.

NOTE: By default, the ECR region is set to `us-east-1`. To override and specify a desired region, you'll need to configure it in the `shippable.yml`. Here's an example, for reference.
```
integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: your_integration_name
      type: ecr
      region: us-west-2
```

##Pull an image from ECR
You can pull any image you have access to, from ECR and use that to spin up your CI build container.

To pull an image, you'll need to do the following:

1. Add the ECR integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the ECR integration for your project.

###Add the ECR integration to your subscription
To add ECR integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the ECR integration for your Subscription, such as `ecr-integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the ECR account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The ECR integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure ECR integration in the `shippable.yml`
To enable ECR integration for your project, add the following to the `shippable.yml` file for that project.
```
pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: manishas/myImage
    image_tag: latest
    pull: true
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: ecr-integration
      type: ecr
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```
While the above is a sample code for your `shippable.yml`, use the descriptions of each field below to modify the `yml` and tailor it to your requirements.

- `image_name:` value is in the format docker-registry-username/docker-registry-image-repo.
- `image_tag:` value is the tag for the image that you want to pull.
- `pull:` set to `true` to pull the image from the specified Image Registry.
- In the `env` section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container. Read more about [environment variables](/ci/advancedOptions/envVar/).
- In the `options` tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your image.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the ECR integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](/ci/troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `ecr`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on pulling images, refer our documentation on [pulling an image](/ci/advancedOptions/images/).

##Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls an image from ECR

If you want to build your Docker image as part of your workflow for each CI run and if your 'Dockerfile' has a `FROM` which pulls a private image from ECR, then you will need to do the following steps:

1. Add the ECR integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the ECR integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are building the Docker image as part of CI.

**IMPORTANT**
If you are using a custom image and you specify an ECR integration in your yml, we will try to login to the registry on your behalf from inside your CI build container.

This means that for custom images, you would need the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed inside your custom image if you want this to succeed, else you will get a `aws: command not found` error.

Get around this by setting `agent_only: true` for ECR integration in your `shippable.yml`.

This will ensure that we will not attempt to login to the registry from inside your CI build container.
However, this also means that you will not be able to pull from or push to ECR in the `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` and `on_failure` sections.

If you do want to use docker commands to interact with ECR in your `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` or `on_failure` sections within your `shippable.yml`, then include the following in your 'Dockerfile' to install the AWS CLI:

`sudo pip install awscli`


###Add the ECR integration to your subscription
To add ECR integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the ECR integration for your Subscription, such as `ecr-integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the ECR account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The ECR integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure ECR integration in the `shippable.yml`

Add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  pre_ci:
    - docker build -t myImage:tip .

  pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: myImage
    image_tag: tip
    pull: false
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: ecr-integration
      type: ecr
      agent_only: true
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```

- `image_name` value is the name of the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- `image_tag` is the tag for the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- set `pull` to `false` if you want to use the image you built during the pre_ci step instead of pulling from a docker registry.
- In the env section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container.
- In the options tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your 'Dockerfile'.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the ECR integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](/ci/troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `ecr`.
- `agent_only:` Set the value to `true` only if you are using a custom Docker image and you want to pull from or push to ECR in the `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` or `on_failure` sections.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on building images as part of the CI, refer our documentation on [building an image](/ci/advancedOptions/images/).

##Push an image to ECR

You can push your image to ECR in the `post_ci` or `push` sections of the `shippable.yml`.

The main difference is that the `post_ci` section runs inside the build container and the `push` section runs outside the build container in the Shippable Agent.

To push an image to ECR, do the following:

1. Add the ECR integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the ECR integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are pushing the Docker image in `post_ci` section or in the `push` section.

**IMPORTANT**
If you are using a custom image and you specify an ECR integration in your yml, we will try to login to the registry on your behalf from inside your CI build container.

This means that for custom images, you would need the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed inside your custom image if you want this to succeed, else you will get a `aws: command not found` error.

Get around this by setting `agent_only: true` for ECR integration in your `shippable.yml`.

This will ensure that we will not attempt to login to the registry from inside your CI build container.
However, this also means that you will not be able to pull from or push to ECR in the `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` and `on_failure` sections.

If you do want to use docker commands to interact with ECR in your `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` or `on_failure` sections within your `shippable.yml`, then include the following in your 'Dockerfile' to install the AWS CLI:

`sudo pip install awscli`

###Add the ECR integration to your subscription
To add ECR integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the ECR integration for your Subscription, such as `ecr-integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the ECR account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The ECR integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure ECR integration in the `shippable.yml`

To push the Docker image to ECR in the `post_ci` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:
    #Commit the container only if you want all the artifacts from the CI step
    - docker commit $SHIPPABLE_CONTAINER_NAME manishas/sample-node:tag
    - docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: ecr-integration
      type: ecr
      agent_only: true
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```

Similarly to push the Docker image to ECR in the `push` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:

  push:
    docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: ecr-integration
      type: ecr
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```


- `integrationName` value is the name of the ECR integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](/ci/troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `ecr`.
- `agent_only:` Set the value to `true` only if you are using a custom Docker image and you want to pull from or push to ECR in the `ci`, `post_ci`, `on_success` or `on_failure` sections.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

##Deleting the Integration

To remove the Amazon ECR integration, you'll need to remove this integration from all dependencies configured to use it. To find all the dependencies:

1. Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the `Integrations` section.
2. Select the Amazon ECR integration from the list of integrations. If you have many entries, use the `Filters` dropdown and select `ECR`. Alternatively, you can use the `Integration Name` field to provide the name of your Amazon ECR integration.
3. Your Amazon ECR integration shows up in the list.
4. Click on the `Delete` button.
5. A window pops up confirming that you want to delete the integration. This window lists all dependencies of this this integration. The list will include any project, environment or subscription image dependent on this integration.
6. If there are dependencies, individually access the `Settings` tab for each project/environment/subscription image and delete the Amazon ECR integration.
7. Once all dependencies of the Amazon ECR integration have been removed, Step 5 will show the message: `No dependency`.
8. Click the `Yes` button to delete the Amazon ECR Integration.
