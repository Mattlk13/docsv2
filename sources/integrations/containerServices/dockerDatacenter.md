# Docker Datacenter
To deploy containers to Docker Datacenter, you need to configure an account integration with credentials to access your Docker Cloud account.

##Adding the Account Integration
The steps to add a Docker Datacenter integration are:

1. Use your own credentials or decide to create a new user with appropriate user permissions, on Docker Cloud, to deploy from Shippable.
2. To create a new user, login to Universal Control Plane (UCP).
3. Go to `Users & Teams` tab and click `Create User`.
4. Sign in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com)
5. Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the 'Integrations' section.
6. Click on the `Add Integration` button.
7. For 'Integration type', choose `Docker Datacenter` from the list of dropdown choices.
8. For 'Integration Name' use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `Docker-Datacenter-Integration`.
9. Enter your username and password.
10. Provide the URL to access the Universal Control Plane.
11. Click on `Save`.
