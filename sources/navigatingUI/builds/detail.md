# Build item details

For each build item in a build, we provide the following:

- Matrix values
- Console for Build item
- Tests coverage visualization
- Coverage visualization
- Scripts (that was run for the build item)
- Download (for console logs)

##Matrix values
Matrix values show what combination of the yml configuration is being used for the build item.

For example, if your yml specifies several versions of a language, the language version for this specific build item is shown.

In the above example, only one version of node_js language is used and hence you see '79.1'.

##Console section
The build item console shows the actual console output for your build.

Sections have a `+` to the left of them and can be collapsed or expanded as desired.

You can also copy text from the console log.

##Tests section
If you have set up your yml to [show test results **UpdateLink**](/ci/shippableyml/),
you will see the visualizations in the `Tests` section.

##Coverage section
Similarly, if you have set up your yml to [show coverage results **UpdateLink**](/ci/shippableyml/),
you will see the visualizations in the `Coverage` section.

## Scripts section
The script section shows you exactly what scripts and commands were run for your build.

In case of a build failure or other issues, you can copy the script and run it locally to see if your build works locally.

This helps tremendously while debugging build problems.

##Downloads section
The `Download` dropdown on the right of the build item console lets you download console logs to your machine.
