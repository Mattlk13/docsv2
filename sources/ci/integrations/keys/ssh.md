# Keys

You can set up integrations for the keys you use to integrate with third party services that do not have a native Integration with our platform.

This allows you to store your keys in your Shippable account and use them in your yml with the help of environment variables.

## SSH

To create an account integration for an SSH key, do the following:

- Go to Account settings by clicking on the gear icon in the top navigation bar.
- Click on the 'Integrations' section.
- Click on the `Add integration` button.
- From the dropdown, select `SSH key`
- Enter a name for your key and then click on the `Generate keys` button. This will generate an SSH key for your account.
- `Save` the generated key.

You will need to add this key to both the 'Subscription' Settings **and** the `shippable.yml` of every project you want to use it in.

Example `shippable.yml` integration:
```
integrations:
  key:
    - integrationName: MySSHKeyIntegration
      type: ssh-key
```
 * `integrationName` is the name of the SSH integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings.
 * `type` is ssh-key

Your SSH key will be available on your build minion in the `/tmp/ssh/` directory. You can then use the key for ssh commands in your `shippable.yml`.
