# Clojure
This page explains yml configuration that is specific to Clojure projects. For a complete yml reference, please read the [Build configuration section](../shippableyml.md)

##yml configuration

The sections below explore sections of the yml that are specific to Clojure projects. 


###language 


For Clojure projects, this tag should always be set to clojure as show below:

```
language: clojure
```

### runtime

You can set the runtime using the `lein` tag:

```
lein:
  - lein2
```

**Important note:** The runtime tag only works with official CI images provided by Shippable. If you are using a custom image for your build, you will need to switch the runtime in the `ci` section of your yml.

### pre_ci and pre_ci_boot

Depending on the `language` and `services` tags in your yml, an official build image is chosen for your build by default, and your build container is started with standard options. The default images for Clojure builds are explained below.

The pre_ci and pre_ci_boot sections are primarily used in one of the following scenarios:

* You want to use a custom Docker image for your CI 
* You want to override the default options that are used to boot up the default CI image

If you do not want to do either of the above, you should skip these tags in the yml.

#### Default Clojure images
We have 2 primary build images for Clojure projects, which should be sufficient for most projects: 

* [dry-dock/u14clo](https://github.com/dry-dock/u14clo) is used if you specify `language: clojure` in your yml and do not specify a `services` tag. This image contains the following:
	
	* Ubuntu 14.04
	* Clojure versions 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0
	* leiningen
	* Git
	* Basic packages sudo, build-essential, curl, gcc, make, openssl, software-properties-common, wget, nano, unzip, libxslt-dev, libxml2-dev
	* Default Java versions: default-jre, default-jdk, openjdk-6, oracle jdk 7  
	* Python packages python-pip, python-software-properties, python-dev
	* Node version 0.10 
	* Default Ruby version
	* Python 2.7.6
	* awscli
	* google-cloud-sdk 

* [dry-dock/u14cloall](https://github.com/dry-dock/u14cloall) is used if you specify one or more services and set the language to go in the yml. This image contains the following **in addition** to everything that is listed for the u14clo image above:

	* couchdb 1.6
	* elasticsearch 1.5
	* neo4j 2.2
	* memcached 1.4
	* mongodb 3.0
	* mysql 5.6
	* postgres 9.4
	* rabbitmq 3.5
	* redis 3.0
	* rethinkdb 2.0
	* riak
	* selenium 2.52
	* sqllite 3


If these official images do not satisfy your requirements, you can do one of 2 things:

- Continue using official images and include commands to install any missing dependencies or packages in your yml
- Use a custom build image that contains exactly what you need for yout CI
	
#### Using a custom build image
If you do decide to use a custom CI image, you will need to configure the `pre_ci_boot` section and optionally, the `pre_ci` section if you're also building the CI image as part of the workflow. Details on how to configure this are available in the [`pre_ci` and `pre_ci_boot` sections of the Build configuration page](../shippableyml.md#build). 

### ci
The `ci` section should contain all commands you need for your `ci` workflow. Commands in this section are executed sequentially. If any command fails, we exit this section with a non zero exit code.

#### Installing dependencies
You can install the required dependencies for your project using protobuf:

```
build:
  ci:
    - lein protobuf install
```


#### Adding test commands 
After installing dependencies, you can include your test commands. For example:  

```
build:
  ci:
    - lein test 
```


#### Test and code coverage
You can view your test and code coverage results in a consumable format and drill down further to find out which tests failed or which sections of your code were not covered by your tests.

Your tests results data needs to be in junit format and your code coverage results need to be in cobertura format in order to see these visualizations. Test and code coverage results need to be saved to shippable/testresults and shippable/codecoverage folders so that we can parse the reports.

#### Testing against multiple JDKs
You can test your projects against one or more supported JDKs: OpenJDK 7, Oracle JDK 7, Oracle JDK 8, OpenJDK 6.

Use the `jdk` flag to achieve this:

```
jdk:
  - openjdk7
  - oraclejdk7
  - oraclejdk8
  - openjdk6
```
The yml above will trigger 4 builds, one against each jdk version. 


#### Default commands

If the `ci` section is blank, we will run a default command. This has the same effect as the yml snippet below:

```
build:
  ci:
    - lein test 
```

To avoid executing the default command, include a simple command in like `pwd` or `ls` in this section.
