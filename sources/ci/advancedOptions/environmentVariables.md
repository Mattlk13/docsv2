# Using environment variables
You can customize your CI workflow by using environment variables. These variables are available to you in all sections of your yml so you can use conditional statements depending on the value(s) of one or more variables.

Shippable provides a standard list of environment variables that are available for every build. You can also define your own variables and use them for your CI workflow.

## User defined Variables

If you need your own environment variables for your build, you can specify these in your yml:

```
# environment variable
env:
  - FOO=foo BAR=bar
```

If you want to trigger builds against combinations of environment variables, you can include the combinations you need, one on each line. FOr example, the yml below will trigger 2 builds for each commit:

```
# environment variable
env:
  - TEST=true PROD=false
  - TEST=false PROD=true
```

Env variables can create an exponential number of builds when combined with `jdk` & `rvm , node_js etc.` i.e. it is multiplicative.

For an example, please check out the [Matrix Builds section](/ci/advancedOptions/matrixBuilds/).

To avoid a matrix build and kick off a single build with all environments, you can use the global tag as detailed in the section below.

###Global variables
If you want to define one or more environment variables that do not trigger multiple builds, you should use the `global` tag.

```
env:
  global:
    - FOO=true
    - BAR=false
```
The snippet above will trigger just one build with both variables set.

If you want to define a set of variables that are global, and another set that trigger a build matrix, you can configure that as shown below:

```
env:
  global:
    - FOO=true
    - BAR=false
  matrix:
    - TEST=test
    - PROD=prod

```
The snippet above will trigger 2 builds: one with environment variables (TEST=test, FOO=true, BAR=false) and another with (PROD=prod, FOO=true, BAR=false).

You can also use encrypted variables in the global or matrix sections if needed. More on encrypted variables below.

### Secure variables
If you need to include environment variables that are used to store sensitive information like passwords or keys, you should encrypt them and enter the encrypted value in your yml.

To encrypt an environment variable, go to your Shippable subscription or project settings. Choose 'Encrypt' from the left sidebar menu. Enter your variables in the textbox in the Encrypt section and click on `Encrypt`. This will give you the encrypted string that you can use in your yml. A more detailed [explanation is given here](../../navigatingUI/projects/settings.md#Encrypt)

<img src="../../images/advancedOptions/encrypt.png" alt="Encrypt Environment Variables" style="width:1000px;"/>

You can then include the encrypted string in your yml using the `secure` tag. The variables are then available during your build:

```
env:
  - secure: <encrypted output>

build:
  ci:
    - echo $FOO  
``` 

As with other user defined environment variables, you can specify multiple secure variables in your yml to trigger a build matrix or specify them as global. 

**Things to remember**

* Due to the security risk of exposing your secure variables, we do not decrypt secure variables for pull request from the forks of public projects. Secure variable decryption is limited to the pull request triggered from the branches on the same repository. 
* Decrypted secured variables are not displayed in the script tab for security reasons.
* Project owners can decrypt secure variables by going to their Settings tab, choosing Encrypt in the sidebar menu, and then entering the secure variable in the Decrypt section. More on [this is explained here](../../navigatingUI/projects/settings.md#Encrypt).
